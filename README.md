Monthly HackyHour meetings in [Göttingen](http://hackyhour.github.io/Goettingen/).

## About
Come to talk about Code, Tools and Science in a social environment.
If you have a problem in one of those areas: bring it along and get help.
We also plan to make hands on sessions where we learn and apply new techniques or tools.
You can also find companions to join a professional or fun project.

For up to date information visit our [website](http://hackyhour.github.io/Goettingen/) or join the future [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) channel.
