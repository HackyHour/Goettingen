# About
Come to talk about **science** and/or computer stuff in a social environment.

If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to meet "open scienc-y" people: join us. Especially if you're stuck on a computational problem in your research feel free to bring it along, we might be able to help (or at least point you in the right direction).

No registration etc. needed!

# When and Where
We meet every first Tuesday of the month at 6 pm in rotating venues that will be announced below. Feel free to join the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/HackyHour/Goettingen?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) and/or the [mailing list](https://listserv.gwdg.de/mailman/listinfo/hackyhour) if you have any questions/topic suggestions beforehand.

We might order Pizza (but you can bring your own **non-messy** food, no soup) and usually sit together until 7.30 pm but will also have open ends (depending on the venue).

Please bring your **own computer**, as we cannot provide any resources in this regard and then can also work through installations.

# Topics
In addition to the open discussions we also aim to talk about specific topics at each HackyHour. However, prior knowledge or interest in these topics is not a prerequisite. Online discussions for these topics are accessible via the following links or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/HackyHour/Goettingen?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).

# Inspiration
This project is inspired by [HACKYHOUR@AUCKLAND](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/HackyHour/) and the [R Study Group](http://minisciencegirl.github.io/studyGroup/). We are affiliated with the [HackyHour WÃ¼rzburg](https://hackyhour.github.io/Wuerzburg/) and are following their shining example. We are both loosely organized under the [HackyHour organization](https://hackyhour.github.io/).
