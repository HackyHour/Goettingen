# About
Come to talk about science in a social environment.
If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to drink a beer: join us.

# When and Where
We are still in the planning phase, more information will be updated soon. Meetings will probably take place in the [Niedersächsische Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Göttingen (SUB)](https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/sub-aktuell/).

In the future we will implement a communication channnel (probably [Gitter](https://gitter.im/)) to determine topics and questions beforehand.

Usually, we order some food and we have an open end.

# Topics
In addition to the open discussions we also aim to talk about specific topics at each HackyHour.
However prior knowledge or interest in these topics is not a prerequisite.
Online discussions for these topics are accessible via the following links.
